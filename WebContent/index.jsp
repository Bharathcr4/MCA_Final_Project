		<span>Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a public-keybased one-to-many encryption that allows users to encrypt and decrypt data based on user attributes.<br/> A promising application of ABE is flexible access control of encrypted data stored in the cloud, using access polices and ascribed attributes associated<br/> with private keys and ciphertexts.<br/>One of the main efficiency drawbacks of the existing ABE schemes is that decryption involves expensive pairing operations and the number of such<br/> operations grows with the complexity of the access policy.Security of an ABE system with outsourced decryption ensures that an adversary (including</br> a malicious cloud) will not be able to learn anything about the encrypted message; however, it does not guarantee the correctness of the transformation</br> done by the cloud.<br/> </span> <div style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="images/enc51.jpg" width="450" height="310"></div>
